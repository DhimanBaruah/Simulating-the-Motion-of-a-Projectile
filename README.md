# Simulating-the-Motion-of-a-Projectile
I tried to simulate the motion of a projectile under the influence of garvity and viscious forces (F) that is  of the form "k.v^{2}" where v is the velocity of the projectile. In order to emphasize the action of the viscious force on the projectile, I considered three scenrios: One without viscous force, with viscious force along x-axis and with viscious along both the axes. 
In my simulation I took the value of k/m to be 1.2*(1e-3).
